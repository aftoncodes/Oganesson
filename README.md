# Oganesson [WIP!!!]

**Oganesson is the only Discord server backup bot your server will ever need.**

Oganesson is a Discord bot made for one, and only one purpose: To back up your Discord server

Whether it's to recover from your server getting raided, your account getting hacked and deleting your server, simply wanting to archive your server or anything else, Oganesson has got you covered.

## How it works

Oganesson hooks into your main server and a backup server, where it will constantly synchronize messages, roles and channels between the two, so that you have that peace of mind. It forwards messages from the main server using webhooks to imitate the user who sent the message, including their name and avatar.

Unlike popular backup bots, such as [Xenon](https://xenon.bot) which store your server backups in cloud databases, Oganesson stores them within Discord itself. The best part, Oganesson is always running in your server! Once you set it up, you never have to worry about it again.
